# Utica, NY land cover mapping project

Code for associated for classifying tree, building, and pavement cover in historical aerial imagery. Code contains land cover classification for three years: 1957, 1974, and 2017. Note that a typo early on labels 1974 files as 1987. This typo was carried through for consistent referal to the year. The accurate year is 1974 in the imagery.

Code contains files for digitizing training masks, training a U-NET model, and merging predictions into final map project. 

**Analysis_figures.r** contains the final analysis and maps that went into a manuscript.
